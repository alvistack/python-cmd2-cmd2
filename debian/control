Description: Tool for building interactive command line apps
 cmd2 is a tool for building interactive command line applications in
 Python. Its goal is to make it quick and easy for developers to build
 feature-rich and user-friendly interactive command line applications. It
 provides a simple API which is an extension of Python's built-in cmd
 module. cmd2 provides a wealth of features on top of cmd to make your
 life easier and eliminates much of the boilerplate code which would be
 necessary when using cmd.
